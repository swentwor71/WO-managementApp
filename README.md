Work Order management application for work to NJUNS

1.0	PURPOSE
1.1.	Business Problem/Opportunity
The work order management process from SAP to NJUNS to time consuming and laborious. There is much of the data that is repetitively entered into multiple places and systems and tracked in several places. In turn the USR does not have the time to manage the projects lifecycle. This process could be streamlined to save time by entering data in less places and interfacing the systems to work with each other.
1.2.	Vision
To be able to enter the data in a single place, have the systems work together and give some extra time to the USRs that is needed for the reporting and management of the project lifecycle.
1.3.	Goals and Objectives
The goals for this project include:
•	Eliminate as much duplicate entry of data as possible
•	Automate creation of NJUNS tickets
•	Streamline process and save time in project tracking and entry process
